# Understanding Labels and Features in NLP

## Overview

This repository aims to provide clarity on the interpretation of labels and features in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In NLP, both labels and features play crucial roles in training machine learning models to analyze and extract meaningful information from text data.

## Interpretation of Labels

In the context of NLP, labels are used to denote the target variables or outputs corresponding to the input text data. These labels guide the model during training and evaluation, helping it learn to make accurate predictions on new, unseen text data.

- **Binary Classification**: In many NLP tasks, binary labels (usually `0` and `1`) are used for binary classification, where the goal is to classify text into one of two categories.

## Inputs as Features

Features in NLP represent the characteristics or attributes extracted from the input text data that are used to train machine learning models. These features encode information about the text, enabling the model to learn patterns and make predictions.

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Stopwords Removal**: Filtering out common words that do not carry significant meaning.
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase to standardize the input.
- **Punctuation Removal**: Removing punctuation marks to focus on word content.
- **Lemmatization/Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form to normalize variations.

## Example Scenarios

### Sentiment Analysis
In sentiment analysis, the labels typically represent the sentiment expressed in the text:
- **Label `1`**: Positive sentiment.
- **Label `0`**: Negative sentiment.

### Topic Classification
In topic classification, the labels indicate the relevance of the text to a particular topic or category:
- **Label `1`**: Relevant to the topic.
- **Label `0`**: Not relevant to the topic.
