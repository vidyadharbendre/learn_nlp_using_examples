# NLP Pipeline

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline using Python. 

The pipeline demonstrates the key steps involved in processing text data, extracting features, building a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Overview

An NLP pipeline is a sequence of processes used to analyze and extract meaningful information from text data. This example demonstrates a simple NLP pipeline with the following steps:
1. Data Collection
2. Text Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Deployment and Monitoring

## Pipeline Steps

### Data Collection
Gather raw text data from various sources such as websites, documents, or social media.

### Text Preprocessing
Prepare the raw text data for analysis by cleaning and normalizing it. This includes tokenization, lowercasing, stop words removal, punctuation removal, and lemmatization/stemming.

### Feature Extraction
Transform text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This can be done using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, word embeddings, and n-grams.

### Model Building
Train machine learning or deep learning models on the extracted features. Common algorithms include Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, and Transformers.

### Model Evaluation
Fine-tune the model to improve its performance. Use hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

### Model Deployment and Monitoring
Deploy the trained model into a production environment, set up an API, and monitor its performance. Regular updates and a feedback loop help maintain and improve the model over time.

## Example Code

Here is a simple example of an NLP pipeline in Python using NLTK and Scikit-learn:

```python
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Data Collection
texts = ["I love machine learning.", "Natural language processing is fascinating.", "Deep learning is part of AI."]
labels = [1, 1, 0]  # Example of binary labels

# Step 2: Text Preprocessing
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))

def preprocess(text):
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens if token.isalnum()]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

processed_texts = [preprocess(text) for text in texts]

# Step 3: Feature Extraction
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(processed_texts)

# Step 4: Model Building
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Step 6 and 7: Model Deployment and Monitoring would involve setting up an API and monitoring framework
